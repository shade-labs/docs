## Linux
First install libdeflate, for example for debian systems: `sudo apt install libdeflate0`

**If the studio has no internet access**, download a zip of offline models from here: https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.shade.inc/linux/models-linux-x64.zip which we'll reference in the script later.

Next, to start the sever, create a file called `shade.bash` in the same directory as the downloaded appimage. The contents of the file should be as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Make sure to point to the downloaded appimage here
export SHADE_EXE=/path/to/the/downloaded/appimage/Shade-x.x.xx-snapshot.AppImage
# Shade gives this key during onboarding. This unlocks unlimited assets and enables broadcasting on all interfaces.
export SHADE_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# Shade sources the models from either the internet or a local model zip if there is not internet. Make sure to set
#  this environment variable if you're running in a shutdown environment.
export SHADE_MODELS_PATH=/path/to/the/downloaded/models/zip/if/necessary.zip

export DISABLE_ANALYTICS=1  # If analytics should be disabled
export SHADE_BROADCAST=0.0.0.0  # To broadcast on all interfaces
export SHADE_PORT=9082  # defaults to 9082 but can be changed here

# Start the server
chmod +x $SHADE_EXE
$SHADE_EXE
```

Make sure to update `SHADE_EXE` and `SHADE_KEY` to point to the appimage and the proper key - if necessary modify `SHADE_MODELS_PATH`.

Now just run `bash ./shade.bash` to start the server.

If any issues arise, we're always happy to help in our discord, over email or live on a call!

## Updating
- **If internet access:** Open the Shade app GUI. On launch, if an update is available the "update is available" window will show. Simply select the relevant update option.
- **If no internet or on terminal:**
  1. Download the new installer from https://shade.inc/download
  2. Overwrite the old appimage with the new one
  3. Make sure to update `SHADE_EXE` and restart the server


## Connecting Linux Clients
Download the Shade app onto any artist/clients/workstations that need to connect to Shade.

Studio clients on the same network only need three pieces of information to connect & search. To locate the server and then for shade to perform path translation.

1. **The network IP address of the Shade Server**. For most setups this is the same as the SMB server on the port `9082`, for example in our organization we have an SMB server at `smb://192.168.193.130`, so the shade address is `http://192.168.193.130:9082`
2. **The path to the shared drive from Shade server's perspective.** For example if the shade server is running an SMB server, which is serving an external drive at `/media/assets`, then this value would be the same: `/media/assets`.
3. **The path to the shared drive from the client/artist perspective**. If clients mount the `assets` folder at `/media/user/assets`, then this value would be `/media/user/assets`.

To fill this information:

1) Launch Shade, on the first screen select `I am using this in a Studio`
2) Fill in the information above into the following screen
3) Continue, then select the relevant workspace from the left sidebar. Clients can index anything locally with the `L` (local) workspace but can take advantage of the server by selecting the other workspaces/servers.
