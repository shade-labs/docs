# Shade Server Quickstart
We designed Shade server to be set up and run in only minutes, while being flexible to meet most studio IT configurations while making updates / maintenance easy. This guide involves two steps.

1) Running the self-hosted server on the shared computer / workstation
2) Connecting clients/artists to that server for searching & indexing

There are two types of studio deployment features based on your team size.

1) [Local wifi based broadcasting designed for teams composed of less than 10 people](/studio/localbroadcast)
2) [High availability Docker / Kubernetes deployment for teams of more than 10 people](/studio/highavailability)

Click to navigate to your respective setup and navigate to the "Connecting Clients" section of the documentation.



Setting up and running the Shade server is done via terminal to enable headless configuration. All studio distributions - including the server distribution - use the build available on the website or on https://shade.inc/download. The backend and client/artist configurations are extremely flexible and can be run on any workstation that has drive access to the files that need to be viewed / searched.

Typical setups include:

- Shade running on a workstation that is connected via SMB or some file share to the relevant shared files while clients/artists are connected to the SMB
- Shade running on a workstation that is connected physically to an external or internal drive, while clients/artists are connected to this workstation over SMB

Running Shade as a studio for high-availability deployment requires a `SHADE_KEY` to be given to your organization from Shade. To obtain this key [contact us](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1KjFenJeNwpOYs2j67hIoI2Mp4P6cny_KGFEqfHiXDx4sKRc8IBbTLnrcBpnblyTkLHTA8UxLm).

Shade will also use applications installed on the workstation to improve file support / indexing. These applications include.

- Blender
- Maya
- Houdini
- After Effects
- Unreal Engine
- Unity
- 3DS Max
