Sometimes you want to add your own description for better search, or add more tags that are specific to you. Shade makes that really easy for you to modify, delete.

## Updating the Metadata of An Asset

Once Shade has indexed an asset, Shade opens an individual asset page that's accessible with all of the metadata we have extracted about the asset.
On the right side, you're easily able to modify the tags and descriptions so that it fits your liking.
