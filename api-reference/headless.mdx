Getting started with Shade headless is easy.

## If you're using the Shade Frontend
If you're set up and using the GUI app, the shade backend is already up and running. You just need to connect to it.

Generally you can use the url `127.0.0.1:9082` or `localhost:9082` and use that URL in the API endpoints and proceed to
reading about the routes you want to use.

## If you're running headless
To run completely headless, we provide the docker image, make sure docker is running and then run:
```bash
docker run -p 9082:9082 shadeinc/shade
```

This will start the shade service on port 9082. Once this is up and running you can jump to the next section to start
using the instance.

## I'm trying to:
Here are some answers to a few common tasks people use our API for.
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search my assets">
      Super easy, just check out the **search** route on the left.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I have a file path but I need the Shade ID">
      We use IDs because it helps us look up files extremely quickly, especially on the scale of millions of assets.
      If you have a file path, you can use the GET /indexing/file path to get it.
