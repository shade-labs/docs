## Why should I index my files?

Shade is built from the ground up with proprietary AI that understands your files and assets for what they are, not what they're named. But we only do this on the assets that you want us to index.
As a result, if you want to leverage Shade's global search capabilities or upgraded neural file search, then you want to index your assets. 

So how do I do that? Well it's really straightforward. 

Simply go to the folder that you want to search in the future, right click, and hit "index".
