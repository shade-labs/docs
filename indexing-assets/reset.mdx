Sometimes you run into errors or you want to reset your library to remove all of your assets from AI indexing. 
Shade makes that easy. 

<Warning>
    If you do decide to reset your database, all of your existing AI tags will be deleted **including** any of your custom descriptions and tags.
    This does a full reset of the Shade app. 
</Warning>

## Removing a Few Files and Folders

If you only want to remove a few assets and folders, head to your settings by going to <kbd>Profile Photo > Settings > Files and Folders</kbd>
This is great in times where you accidentally indexed a folder that you did not want to index.

## Resetting Your Entire Database

<Warning>Again, we highly don't recommend doing this unless there has been an error. If there is an error, please let us know in our [discord](https://discord.gg/h8wqFMJ4vK) before proceeding</Warning>

To remove all of your assets from the Shade database, head to the **Indexing** tab on the sidebar and check out the indexing status page.
At the bottom there will be a button called **Reset Database**. Click that and confirm that you want to reset your database.
