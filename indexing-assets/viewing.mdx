## How to see if a folder is indexed

To check if a folder has been indexed, you'll be able to see it directly in the finder view. When you navigate to a folder, if that folder is purple, that means it is actively indexed by Shade and the contents of the folder
are searchable in Shade Search once it has finished indexing.

## How to see indexing progress

As you are indexing, you can click on the indexing progress to see what current files are being indexed along with the progress and the total number of assets detected by Shade.
