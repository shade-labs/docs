## Shade Core Engine

As your assets are indexed, Shade's core engine works to provide tags on images, videos, 3D objects, and texture data. The tags are shown under the asset. 

<Info>
ðŸ’¡ Although the indexing produces tags, the core engine utilizes neural search to match a search query to the best collection of assets.
