## People Recognition

* This feature is only available with Pro, Lifetime or Enterprise subscription plans.

As your assets are indexed, Shade will classify certain assets by the respective people that are shown.

Faces are available in the 'All People' tab in the left sidebar. This tab is hidden unless faces are available. Shade will create a collection of a certain face if more than 5 occurences are detected within your asset library.

After indexing, you can find different people captured within your assets, and be able to apply additional search filters to find the specific assets you are looking for.

You can also use the name you attach to each face in any of the Shade search bars with an optional extra description to filter for assets containing the respective person.
