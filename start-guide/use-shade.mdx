## Creating An Account

Log in or create your Shade account via the Sign in With Email Address and Password (more authentication methods to come soon) 

## Set Up

If this is the first time accessing the app, the application will ask you a series of questions and walk you through the setup phase which includes getting some more details about you, and adding files and folders from your computer. 

Once youâ€™ve filled out all the details, simply start adding files and folders to Shade.  

Once files and folders are added, Shadeâ€™s backend process will begin indexing your assets and using AI to autocatalogue, organize, and make your assets searchable for you. This is now a time where you can sit back and wait as you begin to see your assets visualize onto your screen.

<Info>
ðŸ’¡ Shade looks for various applications on your computer to help render various files. For example, if you have a .mb file, Shade will look for Autodesk Maya on your computer to render it out. If you have a .blend file, Shade will look for Blender, etc. etc. This enables Shade to render everything locally without having to use the cloud and enables you to get access to searching your files faster.

## Adding Your Files from the App

There are a few ways to add files from Shade. I'll show you one way here by clicking the Add New button in the top left.

## Viewing Files and Assets

As seen in the video above, we offer you multiple views and methods to access and filter across your assets, including a Discover page, an all assets view that enables you to see all of your assets in a high level view, recently added (to see what assets you just added) and more. Youâ€™re able to easily organize assets too into collections (and see the ones that Shade has created for you as well).

Here you can see that Shade has indexed all of my assets that I just indexed above.

Hereâ€™s a view where I can see all of my materials that I have indexed.

## Conclusion

And thatâ€™s how you get started! Itâ€™s super simple and straightforward. Simply install the application and start throwing assets at it. Shade will organize and go through all of your assets, create visual previews for you to see, and enable you to easily access and search them.
